Thrilled to share my latest **BMW Sales Analysis Dashboard**, now built in **Tableau** for powerful, interactive storytelling.

🔍 **Key Highlights:**

* **Sales Overview:** 253.38M total sales volume analyzed across multiple BMW models.
* **Performance Metrics:** Mileage, pricing, and sales classification in one unified view.
* **Model-Wise Trends:** Fuel type distribution, engine size analysis, and price comparisons.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Year slider (2010–2024) for trend exploration over time.
* **Visual Variety:** Line graphs, bar charts, and donut charts for a clear, impactful narrative.

💡 **Why Tableau?**
Tableau’s flexibility and visual fluency allowed me to transform raw datasets into an interactive decision-making tool — enabling stakeholders to explore patterns, identify best-selling models, and align strategies with market demand.

Data is powerful, but **data visualized is unforgettable**.
